# LandMarking Infrastructure

## Overview

This directory contains infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations for deploying the LandMarking system to various environments. The infrastructure is designed to be scalable, secure, and resilient, with support for both cloud and edge deployments.

## Infrastructure Architecture

The LandMarking system is deployed using a hybrid architecture:

- **Core Cloud Infrastructure**: Main backend services, databases, and API gateways
- **Regional Edge Nodes**: For improved performance and offline capabilities in remote areas
- **Development Environment**: For local development and testing
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automated building, testing, and deployment

## Cloud Infrastructure

### Core Components

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: For containerized services
- **PostgreSQL**: Main relational database with PostGIS extension
- **MongoDB**: Document storage for attachments and unstructured data
- **Redis**: For caching and session management
- **Object Storage**: For document storage
- **Kafka**: For event-driven architecture
- **Elasticsearch**: For search and logging
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: For monitoring and alerting
- **Istio**: Service mesh for microservices

### Networking

- **VPC**: Isolated network environment
- **Subnets**: Public and private subnets across availability zones
- **Security Groups**: Firewall rules for service access
- **Load Balancers**: For distributing traffic
- **API Gateway**: For API management
- **CDN**: For content delivery
- **VPN**: For secure access to internal services

### Security

- **IAM**: Identity and access management
- **KMS**: Key management for encryption
- **WAF**: Web application firewall
- **DDoS Protection**: Protection against distributed denial of service attacks
- **Certificate Management**: For TLS/SSL certificates
- **Secrets Management**: For storing sensitive information

## Edge Infrastructure

### Edge Node Components

- **Kubernetes Edge**: Lightweight Kubernetes for edge nodes
- **Local Database**: PostgreSQL for local data storage
- **Sync Service**: For data synchronization with cloud
- **Caching**: Local caching for improved performance
- **File Storage**: For local document storage
- **Monitoring**: Local monitoring and health checks

### Deployment Options

- **Regional Office**: Full deployment in government regional offices
- **Mobile Unit**: Compact deployment for mobile land registration units
- **Disconnected Mode**: Deployment for areas with limited connectivity

## Development Environment

The local development environment uses Docker Compose to provide:

- **Local Kubernetes**: K3d or Minikube
- **Local Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis
- **Local Object Storage**: MinIO
- **Local Kafka**: For event handling
- **Traefik**: For local routing

docker-compose up -d
```

## Scaling Considerations

The infrastructure is designed to scale in several dimensions:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances of services
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase resources for services
- **Regional Scaling**: Deploy to additional regions
- **Edge Expansion**: Add more edge nodes
- **Database Scaling**: Scaling databases through replication and sharding

## Monitoring and Operations

The monitoring stack includes:

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus for collecting metrics

- **Logging**: ELK stack for log aggregation
- **Alerting**: Alert Manager for notifications
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **Health Checks**: Probes for service health

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

The system implements a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy:

- **Object Storage Replication**: Cross-region replication of objects
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Documented procedures for recovery
- **Backup Testing**: Regular testing of restore procedures
- **Transaction Logs**: Point-in-time recovery capabilities

## Security Considerations

The infrastructure implements several security measures:

- **Network Isolation**: Segmentation of network traffic
- **Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Least privilege access
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Patch Management**: Automated patching of systems
- **Compliance**: Alignment with relevant regulations

## Environment Management

The system supports multiple environments:

- **Development**: For active development
- **Staging**: For pre-production testing
- **Production**: For live systems
- **Edge**: For remote deployments
