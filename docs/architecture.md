  - Historical claim data

- **Local Storage**: SQLite
  - Offline data capture on devices
  - Synchronization queues
  - Temporary storage for field operations

- **Blockchain Ledger**: Hyperledger Fabric
  - Immutable record of verified land transactions
  - Smart contracts for automated verification
  - Transparent audit trail

- **Cache Layer**: Redis
  - Session management
  - Frequently accessed data
  - Synchronization locks

### Integration Layer

  - Government Registry Integration
  - Satellite Imagery Providers
  - ID Verification Systems
  - Payment Processors

- **Export/Import Services**
  - GIS data formats (Shapefile, GeoJSON)
  - PDF certificate generation
  - Bulk data import tools

### Infrastructure

- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS/Azure
  - Managed Kubernetes for services
  - Managed databases for reliability
  - CDN for static content delivery

- **Edge Nodes**:
  - Regional servers in government offices
  - Local caching and processing
  - Resilient to network interruptions

- **Offline Support Infrastructure**:
  - Sync servers with conflict resolution
  - Progressive data synchronization
  - Prioritized data transfer for low bandwidth

## Technical Considerations

### Offline Operation

- Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for reliable merging
- Store-and-forward architecture for disconnected operation
- Background synchronization when connectivity is available
- Prioritization of critical data for limited bandwidth scenarios

### Security

- Multi-factor authentication with SMS verification
- Role-based access control with hierarchical permissions
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Digital signatures with public key infrastructure
- Tamper-evident storage for all records
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Scalability & Performance

- Horizontal scaling for services
- Database sharding for regional data
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed records
- Asynchronous processing for background tasks
- Optimized mobile data usage for field operations

### Resilience

- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Data replication across multiple zones
- Graceful degradation during partial outages
- Regular automated backups

## Data Flow

1. **Land Registration Process**:
   - Field capture → Local validation → Community verification → Official approval → Blockchain recording → Certificate issuance

2. **Offline Workflow**:
   - Local capture and storage → Queued for sync → Transmission when connected → Conflict resolution if needed → Central system update

3. **Verification Process**:
   - Claim submission → Neighbor notifications → Community review → Local authority approval → Government verification → Public record update

## User Personas & Access Levels

- **Field Agents**: Mobile app access, data collection capabilities
- **Community Leaders**: Verification rights, local dispute resolution
- **Government Officials**: Administrative access, final approval rights
- **Property Owners**: Limited access to own records, verification requests
- **General Public**: Search access to public records only
- **System Administrators**: Full system access with audit trails

This architecture balances technical capabilities with the practical constraints of operating in Sierra Leone, providing immediate value while enabling future growth and integration.
