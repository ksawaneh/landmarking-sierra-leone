# LandMarking User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the LandMarking system, a digital platform designed to help communities in Sierra Leone document, map, and verify land ownership. This user-friendly tool allows you to create digital records of land parcels, collect supporting evidence, and participate in community-based verification.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

## Creating a New Land Parcel

To register a new land parcel:

1. Click "Register New Parcel" from the dashboard
2. Complete the three-step process:

### Step 1: Parcel Information

Enter basic information about the land:
- **Land Use**: Select how the land is used (residential, agricultural, etc.)
- **Community**: Select which community the land belongs to
- **Notes**: Add any relevant information about the parcel

You can also use AI-assisted boundary detection:
- Enter coordinates or use your current location
- Click "Detect Boundary with AI"
- The system will analyze satellite imagery and suggest a boundary
- You can proceed to the next step if you're satisfied with the results

### Step 2: Map Boundary

Define the boundary of your land parcel using one of these methods:

**Option 1: GPS Tracking**
- Click "Start GPS Tracking"
- Walk the perimeter of your land with your mobile device
- The app will record your path
- Click "Stop" when you've completed the perimeter

**Option 2: Manual Drawing**
- Use the map controls to zoom to your location
- Click on the map to create boundary points
- Complete the boundary by connecting back to the starting point

**Option 3: AI Improvement**
- If your boundary needs refinement, use "Improve Existing Boundary"
- The AI will suggest improvements to make the boundary more accurate

### Step 3: Confirm & Submit

Review the information:
- Verify the land use and boundary are correct
- Check the calculated area
- Submit the parcel for registration

The system will generate a unique parcel number and save the information. In offline mode, the data will be stored locally and synchronized when internet connectivity is restored.

## Offline Usage

LandMarking works offline with these features:

An offline indicator shows your connection status. When you regain internet connectivity, the app will automatically synchronize your local changes with the server.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **For accurate GPS tracking**:
   - Walk at a steady pace
   - Hold your device with a clear view of the sky
   - Stay as close to the actual boundary as possible

2. **For document uploads**:
   - Ensure photos are clear and well-lit
   - Include visible landmarks or boundary markers in photos
   - Make sure text in documents is legible

3. **For community verification**:
   - Involve respected community members as witnesses
   - Be thorough in reviewing boundaries
   - Provide detailed comments for any disputes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: Changes not saving
