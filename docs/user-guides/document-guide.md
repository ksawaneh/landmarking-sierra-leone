# Document Management Guide

This guide explains how to use the document management features in the LandMarking system. Proper documentation is essential for supporting land claims and providing evidence during the verification process.

## Why Documents Matter

Supporting documents serve several important purposes:

1. **Evidence of ownership or rights**: Provides proof of your claim to the land
2. **Boundary verification**: Shows physical markers or features that define boundaries
3. **Historical record**: Documents how long the land has been used or occupied
4. **Dispute resolution**: Helps resolve conflicts by providing objective evidence
5. **Community verification**: Allows community members to better evaluate claims

## Types of Useful Documents

The following types of documents can strengthen your land registration:

### Official Documents
- Land certificates
- Survey documents
- Purchase agreements or deeds
- Inheritance documents
- Government-issued permits or approvals
- Tax receipts related to the land

### Photos of Physical Evidence
- Boundary markers (stones, fences, trees)
- Structures on the land
- Natural features that define boundaries
- Aerial photographs
- Crops or land improvements

### Historical Records
- Traditional documents recognized by the community
- Historical maps showing the parcel
- Letters or statements from previous owners
- Community records mentioning the land
- Photos showing historical use

### Testimonial Evidence
- Written statements from elders or neighbors
- Records of oral history about the land
- Signed verification forms from adjacent landowners

## Managing Documents in LandMarking

### Uploading Documents

To add documents to a parcel:

1. Navigate to the parcel detail page
2. Click "Manage Documents"
3. You can upload files in two ways:
   - Drag and drop files onto the upload area
   - Click "Browse Files" to select files from your device
4. The system supports:
   - Images (JPEG, PNG, HEIC)
   - Documents (PDF)
   - Maximum file size: 10MB per file
   - Up to 10 documents per parcel (may vary by community)

### Document Status

Each document will have one of these status labels:

- **Pending**: Recently uploaded, not yet reviewed
- **Verified**: Reviewed and accepted as valid
- **Rejected**: Reviewed and determined to be invalid or insufficient

### Viewing Documents

From the parcel detail page:
1. A preview of recent documents appears in the "Supporting Documents" section
2. Click on any document to view it in more detail
3. Click "View all documents" to see the complete list if there are more than 3

From the document management page:
1. All documents are listed with their:
   - Filename
   - File type (image or document)
   - Upload date
   - Verification status

### Deleting Documents

If you need to remove a document:
1. Go to the "Manage Documents" page
2. Find the document you want to delete
3. Click the delete (trash can) icon
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted

Note: Once a document has been verified, you may not be able to delete it without administrator approval.

## Best Practices for Documentation

### Quality Guidelines

For the most effective documentation:

1. **Image clarity**: Ensure photos are clear, well-lit, and focused
2. **Context**: Include enough surrounding area in photos to establish location
3. **Scale**: Include objects of known size in photos when relevant
4. **Legibility**: Make sure text in documents is readable
5. **Completeness**: Include full documents, not partial pages
6. **Authenticity**: Only upload genuine, unaltered documents

### File Organization

Before uploading:
1. Give your files descriptive names (e.g., "North_Boundary_Marker.jpg" instead of "IMG12345.jpg")
2. Organize photos by type (boundaries, structures, historical evidence)
3. Consider adding dates to filenames when relevant

### Offline Document Collection

If you're collecting documentation while offline:
1. Take photos or scan documents as usual
2. The LandMarking app will store them locally
3. When you return to an area with connectivity, open the app
4. The documents will automatically synchronize with the server

## Document Security and Privacy

Documents uploaded to the LandMarking system are:
1. Encrypted during transmission
2. Stored securely on protected servers
3. Accessible only to:
   - You (the uploader)
   - Community verifiers (for verification purposes)
   - System administrators
   - Officials with proper authorization

## Collecting Effective Documentation

### Boundary Documentation Tips

When documenting boundaries:
1. Take photos from both sides of the boundary
2. Include wide shots showing the entire boundary line
3. Take close-ups of specific markers or features
4. Include photos with neighboring parcels visible
5. If possible, take photos with GPS location enabled

### Structure Documentation Tips

When documenting structures on the land:
1. Take photos of all permanent structures
2. Include photos showing the relationship between structures and boundaries
3. Document any historical or traditional structures

### Tips for Specific Contexts

**For agricultural land:**
- Document different crops or planting areas
- Include irrigation systems or land improvements
- Capture seasonal features that may not be visible year-round

**For urban or residential land:**
- Document access points and roads
- Show relationships to neighboring structures
- Include utility connections if relevant

**For community or shared land:**
- Document areas of different uses
- Include evidence of community management
- Show historical community activities on the land

## Troubleshooting Document Issues

### Common Upload Problems

**Problem**: File upload fails
**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the file is under the 10MB size limit
- Try converting the file to a different format
- Reduce image resolution if the file is too large

**Problem**: Document appears distorted
**Solutions**:
- Try re-uploading in a different format
- Ensure the original is properly oriented
- Check that the original is good quality

**Problem**: Document is pending for a long time
**Solutions**:
- Verification may take time depending on community processes
- Check if additional documentation is needed
- Contact a community administrator for assistance
