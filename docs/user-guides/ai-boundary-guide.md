# AI-Assisted Boundary Detection Guide

This guide explains how to use the AI-assisted boundary detection feature in the LandMarking system. This technology helps you create more accurate land parcel boundaries with less effort.

## What is AI Boundary Detection?

AI boundary detection uses satellite imagery to automatically identify land parcel boundaries based on visible features like:
- Fences and walls
- Roads and paths
- Changes in vegetation
- Natural boundaries like rivers or tree lines

The system analyzes these features to suggest a boundary, which you can then adjust if needed.

## Benefits of Using AI Boundary Detection

- **Save time**: Create boundaries in seconds instead of manually walking or drawing
- **Improve accuracy**: Detect boundaries that might be difficult to see on the ground
- **Work remotely**: Map parcels from a distance when necessary
- **Consistent results**: Reduce human error in boundary mapping

## How to Use AI Boundary Detection

### Option 1: Create a New Boundary

When registering a new parcel:

1. Go to the "Register New Parcel" page
2. Fill in the basic parcel information
3. Scroll down to the "AI-Assisted Boundary Detection" section
4. Provide the boundary location using one of these methods:
   - Enter latitude and longitude coordinates
   - Click "Use My Location" to use your current GPS position
   - Enter an address or landmark (in a future update)
5. Set the search radius (100-1000 meters)
6. Click "Detect Boundary with AI"
7. Wait for the system to process the satellite imagery (typically 5-15 seconds)
8. Review the detected boundary and confidence score
9. If satisfied, the boundary will be automatically added to your parcel
10. Proceed to the next step to review and confirm

### Option 2: Improve an Existing Boundary

If you've already created a boundary through GPS tracking or manual drawing:

1. Go to the "Map Boundary" step
2. Scroll down to the "AI-Assisted Boundary Detection" section
3. Click "Improve Existing Boundary"
4. The AI will analyze your current boundary and satellite imagery
5. Review the improved boundary suggestion
6. Accept the changes if they're more accurate

## Understanding Confidence Scores

When the AI detects a boundary, it provides a confidence score that indicates how certain it is about the results:

- **90-100%**: Very high confidence - The boundary is clearly visible and well-defined
- **75-89%**: High confidence - Most of the boundary is visible with some uncertainties
- **60-74%**: Moderate confidence - Parts of the boundary are visible but some areas are uncertain
- **Below 60%**: Low confidence - Limited visible features or ambiguous boundaries

For low confidence results, consider:
- Using GPS tracking as a complement
- Manually adjusting the boundary
- Trying a different location point or radius

## Land Use Detection

As a bonus feature, the AI can also analyze the detected land area and suggest the most likely land use type:

- Residential
- Agricultural
- Commercial
- Industrial
- Forestry
- etc.

This is shown with its own confidence percentage. You can accept this suggestion or change it manually based on your knowledge of the area.

## Limitations to Consider

While AI boundary detection is powerful, be aware of these limitations:

1. **Image quality**: Results depend on the quality and recency of available satellite imagery
2. **Rural vs. urban**: Detection works better in areas with clear visual boundaries
3. **Natural boundaries**: Some natural boundaries like unmarked property lines may be difficult to detect
4. **Complex parcels**: Very irregular or complex shapes may need manual adjustment
5. **Uncertain legal boundaries**: The AI detects visible boundaries, not necessarily legal property lines

## Best Practices

For best results with AI boundary detection:

1. **Center point selection**: Choose a point near the center of the parcel, not at the edge
2. **Radius setting**: Use a radius that comfortably contains the entire parcel without too much extra area
3. **Verification**: Always verify the AI-generated boundary against your knowledge of the actual property
4. **Documentation**: Include traditional boundary markers in your supporting documents
5. **Community verification**: Use the community verification process to validate the accuracy

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: AI detection is not working or producing errors
**Solution**: Check your internet connection. This feature requires online connectivity.

**Problem**: Boundary detection is very inaccurate
**Solution**: Try adjusting the center point, using a different radius, or manually drawing the boundary instead.

**Problem**: The system shows "Processing failed"
**Solution**: Wait a few minutes and try again. If the problem persists, report the issue through the Help section.
